I just like having a place to write down notes/todo/research
feel free to add to this if you like chris

Not sure if the domain you are testing is dnssec enabled? use this!

havn't read through it yet but it looks as thorough as you can get without ino-depth technical stuff. lots of diagrams

Not too in depth but nice diagram/example

=== WHAT ON EARTH IS DNSSEC ====
Digital Signiture - Hash the data, then encrypt that with private key. If someone (client / receiver) has the public key, data, and the signiture, they can 1) decrypt the signiture and 2) hash the data themselves. Then they compare the hashes.

DNS Zone - A category/group of managed domains. Could be just one or multiple! Zones exist to provide better management/control/authentication than just assigning each domain to a different server.

RRSet - A group of resource records (such as A records for ex)

DS record - Used to identify a zone using its (zone signing) public key. Created using a DNSKey record. DS records contain the following:
  * Info about algotithms used to generate zone key pair, and hashes
  * Hash of the DNSKey record

RRSig - The signiture of an RRset, stored as a RR

DNSKey - An RR which contains a public key. Could have been called an RRKey record but oh well too late

Chain of Trust - More or less follows this process:
  1) You already have the public key of the root server, and trust it. Root zone is current zone.
  2) Request DS record of next zone from current zone
  3) Request DNSKey record (public key) from next zone
  4) Hash the public key in the DNSKey record, and compare it to the hash in the DS record you got from current. If it matches, we now trust this zone!
  5) Next is now the current zone, repeat from step 2

### Road Map
1. Figure out the roadmap


my suggestion for where to go from here. using 'example.com' as an example  -sam
	- Make sure we get RRSIG, DNSKEY and A from example.com
	- Verify RRSIG by using DNSKEY. I think we use SHA-2-something on the RRSET (probably just the 1 A record we got?) then hash the result?
	- Next try to get the DS record from 'com' domain. Compare the two, i believe by hashing the 'example.com' DNSKEY and comparing the two
	- Turn this into a loop which keeps going until parent domain is reached
	- IDK what to do about root, ask prof about that
