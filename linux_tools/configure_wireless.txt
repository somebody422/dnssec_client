if you run into problems, it may be logged on ringbuffer, 'dmesg | less'

Check your status with:
'iwconfig'
'ip addr'
'ip link'


== Make sure you have a driver:
'lspci -k'
look for a "Network controller"


== Enable the network device:
List devices with 'ip link'. Anything that shouldn't be enabled do 'ip link set DEVICE down'
'ip link set DEVICE up'


== Scan and connect
'iwlist DEVICE scan'
'iwconfig DEVICE essid NETWORK_NAME key WIRELESS_KEY'
note that if there is no key/password, just omit the key part. You may already be connected (especially if you have dhcp service running). if not, try running dhcp client manually:
'dhclient -v DEVICE'
