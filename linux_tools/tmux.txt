tmux is a terminal emulator, more or less replacing 'screen'

Session - A named tmux session. Just typing "tmux" will create a new one.
Window - Takes up the whole screen. A session can have a bunch of windows
Pane - A window can be broken up into a bunch of panes, using horizontal and vertical splits


Subcommands: Most of these will be called using the ctl-b-: prompt from within tmux (without the 'tmux' prefix)
'tmux ls' - list current sessions
'tmux attach-session -t NAME' - attach session NAME
'tmux rename-session -t OLD_NAME NEW_NAME'



Within a session, ctl-b is the tmux escape key. Type shortcuts after that or ':' to type at the tmux prompt

ctl-b:
	* d - detatch the current session
	* $ - rename current session
