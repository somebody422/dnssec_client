There are 2 standard schemes for partitioning a disk:
	* Master Boot Record (MBR) - This is the older one.
		- The first 512 bytes are the actual MBR, which contains a bootloader for the OS and the parition info. BIOS (or whatever starts up the pc) will use this loader
		- 3 types of partition:
			* Primary - Pretty much a regular partition. I'm guessing this was just a "partition" until someone was like "oh shit we need more than 4"
			Also you can only have 4
			* Extended - one of the primary can be dubbed an "extended" partition. can only have one of these
			* Logical - sub-partitions inside an extended partition
	* GUID Partition Table (GPT) - Meant to replace MBR
		- If you boot with BIOS (instead of UEFI), must have a BIOS boot partition!! GUID is made to work well with UEFI.
		- GPT also uses the first bunch of bytes in the disk for bootloader and partition info


====== FDISK ======
fdisk is the de facto way to partition disks in linux

'fdisk -l' - list disks and partitions

'fdisk DEVICE' - start fdisk session on device

fdisk commands:
	* p - Print the partition table
	* w - Write changes to the disk
	* q - Quit, don't save anything
	* n - Create a new partition
	* d - Delete a partition


========= Formatting  ==========
After setting partitions, format the disk
'mkfs.FORMAT_TYPE DEVICE' - EX: 'mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1'
For swap space use the following:
	'mkswap DEVICE'
	'swapon DEVICE'



======== Bootloader ========
You will need to install a bootloader

Grub for GPT: 'grub-install DEVICE'
Then create the config. This has to be done any time you change grub settings or files
'grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg'
