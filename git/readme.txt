its finally time to learn git


CURRENTLY: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials
on the "setting up a repository" tutorial


remote - A repository somewhere else (not on this computer). Creating a remote using git is like giving a nickname for a url. 


'git init' - initialize this as a git repository (.git directory)

'git init --bare' - Bare repos do not contain a working copy of the code. They are made to be a hub or node which can be cloned and updated by developers. You do not do development in a bare repo.


'git remote' or 'git remote -v' - list the remote names and their corresponding URLs
